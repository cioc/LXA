Hey!

This is the LXA project!  The goal of this projext is automatic allomorphy learning.  Furthermore, we intend to do some awesome stuff with language visualization.  

It has its roots in the Linguistica Project: http://linguistica.uchicago.edu/

Currently, the project consists of two people:

John Goldsmith - http://hum.uchicago.edu/~jagoldsm/Webpage/index.html
Charles Cary - http://charlescary.com/
